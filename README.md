# ConcatQuiz
A little quiz I wrote to test students' knowledge of concatenating strings to be printed with Console.WriteLine() in C#

Unfortunately the NUnit Framework isn't yet working properly in dotnetfiddle.net 
so I wrote this as a workaround until I find an easier way 
to generate my own tests and check them... I'm absolutely sure there's a more elegant way! :)

This program should also be available here and able to run (in your web browser!) https://dotnetfiddle.net/L1rGbE
